_Each year, in Autumn, students showcase their own projects in a public event, kindly hosted by I3P._

In 2017, the project showcase will be on **October 3** from 17:00 to 19:00.

During the showcase, students of Politecnico di Torino can meet professionals, companies, and start-ups that work in the Smart Home, Interaction Design and Internet of Things domains.

Students will present prototypes that employ wearable and mobile devices, wireless sensors, IoT devices, advanced interaction modalities, ... thought for homes, buildings, and cities.

Participation at the showcase is **free**, but registration is _mandatory_. For further information, to register, and to examine the showcase program, please refer to the [Treatabit website](http://www.treatabit.com/article/ambient-intelligence-students-showcase-sustainability-edition) (in Italian).
